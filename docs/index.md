# RetailPulse

A scalable, web-based system for multi-store billing and inventory for wholesale businesses.

## The Problem

As a wholesale business grows from a single store to multiple locations, it faces significant operational challenges:

### 1. Lack of Centralized Control

Owners cannot get a clear, real-time view of performance across all stores. Each location operates in a silo, making it impossible to compare sales, manage stock, or enforce product handling standards effectively.

### 2. Complex Inventory Management

Tracking product inventory becomes a nightmare. It's difficult to know the exact stock levels at each location, leading to overstocking in one store and stockouts in another. Tracking critical details like batch numbers, expiry dates, and storage conditions (e.g., cold storage) across a network of stores is difficult with manual methods.

### 3. Inefficient Operations

Manual processes like handwriting bills, physically checking stock, and consolidating paper reports are slow, prone to errors, and do not scale as the business expands.
