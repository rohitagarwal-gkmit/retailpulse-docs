A scalable, web-based system for multi-store billing and inventory for medical wholesalers.

## The Problem

As a medical wholesale business grows from a single store to multiple locations, it faces significant operational challenges:

### 1. Lack of Centralized Control
Owners cannot get a clear, real-time view of performance across all stores. Each location operates in a silo, making it impossible to compare sales, manage stock, or enforce product handling standards effectively.

### 2. Complex Inventory Management
Tracking product inventory becomes a nightmare. It's difficult to know the exact stock levels at each location, leading to overstocking in one store and stockouts in another. Tracking critical details like batch numbers, expiry dates, and storage conditions (e.g., cold storage) across a network of stores is difficult with manual methods.

### 3. Inefficient Operations
Manual processes like handwriting bills, physically checking stock, and consolidating paper reports are slow, prone to errors, and do not scale as the business expands.

### The Old Workflow (The Hard Way)

A pharmacy calls with an order. A sales user manually checks for the product. A bill is written on paper. At the end of the week, the store manager sends a report to the head office. The owner has no real-time visibility and can't move surplus stock from one store to another that needs it.

## The Solution – RetailPulse

RetailPulse is a centralized, web-based system that empowers medical wholesalers to manage their entire network of stores from a single platform.

1.  **Multi-Store Billing**: Fast, digital billing at each location, with all data instantly available at the head office.
2.  **Granular Product Inventory**: Track your entire inventory in real-time, right down to the specific batch, expiry date, and location (e.g., Shelf A1, Cold Storage) in each store.
3.  **Centralized Reporting**: Get a bird's-eye view of your entire business or drill down into the performance of a single store.

### The New, Transformed Workflow

A customer calls with an order. A sales user creates a digital bill in seconds. The system automatically deducts the product from the specific batch in that store's inventory. The sale is instantly reflected in both the store's and the company's reports. The owner sees everything in real-time.
