A simple, web-based system for billing, inventory, and reports for medical wholesalers.

## The Problem

Medical wholesalers face three main challenges:

### 1. Manual Bill Generation is Slow
Managers spend too much time writing bills by hand. This leads to wasted hours, mistakes, and lost paper bills.

### 2. Inventory is Hard to Manage
It's difficult to track stock levels in real-time. This causes expired medicines to go unnoticed, stockouts, and errors in records.

### 3. No Business Visibility
Owners lack clear information on sales, profits, and trends. They spend hours reviewing paper bills and cannot make data-driven decisions.

### Current Workflow (The Hard Way)

Customer arrives → Manager checks stock by hand → Writes bill on paper → Calculates total → Updates inventory book → Files paper bill → Owner reviews bills weekly.

This process is slow, error-prone, and lacks real-time information.
